# Add seeking to F1TV video player

For whatever reason, the F1TV video player doesn't allow you to seek forwards/backwards with the arrow keys. This code simply adds an event handler to the arrow keys to trigger the seeking behavior on the F1TV video player. The code is set to seek 10 seconds at a time.

This script can be added to your browser in one of 3 ways:

1) Chrome extension

Listing pending review...

2) Firefox addon

Downloadable here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/seek-f1-tv-video-stream/

3) Violent Monkey

If you have the violent monkey, you don't have to install any additional extensions. Just add the `violent_monkey_script.js` script.
