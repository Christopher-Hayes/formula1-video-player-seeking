# Add seeking to F1TV video player

For whatever reason, the F1TV video player doesn't allow you to seek forwards/backwards with the arrow keys. This code simply adds an event handler to the arrow keys to trigger the seeking behavior on the F1TV video player. The code is set to seek 10 seconds at a time.
